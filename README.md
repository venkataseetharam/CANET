# Segmentation of Indian Traffic

## Description
This project implements the "Attention-guided Chained Context Aggregation" method from scratch for semantic segmentation, focusing on the segmentation of traffic in Indian scenarios. It demonstrates a novel approach to addressing complex image segmentation challenges in the realm of computer vision and deep learning.

## Key Achievements
- **Complete Implementation from Scratch:** The project showcases a fully self-developed implementation of the Attention-guided Chained Context Aggregation technique, underscoring expertise in neural network architecture and deep learning.
- **Innovative Approach:** By incorporating an Attention-guided Chained Context Aggregation method, the project addresses intricate aspects of semantic segmentation in traffic scenes, especially those prevalent in Indian roads.
- **Significant Performance Improvement:** The project improved the Intersection over Union (IoU) score dramatically. Starting from a baseline IoU of 0.5 with a standard U-Net model, the new approach achieved an impressive IoU of 0.7, marking a substantial advancement in segmentation accuracy.
- **Rigorous Development and Evaluation:** Extensive hyperparameter tuning and meticulous model training and evaluation were conducted to ensure the robustness and superiority of the developed solution.
